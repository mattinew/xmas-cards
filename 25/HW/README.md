# Hardware design
In this folder, all the details of the hardware project will be stored.

## Main idea: create a physical token showing a QR code that links to the Github page published from the SW folder.

- [ ] Create new repository folder and identify the link.
- [ ] Create the QR code image with identified link.
  - Check [QR.io](https://qr.io/) and [MiniQR](https://mini-qr-code-generator.vercel.app/).
  - Modify manually if necessary.
- [ ] Save the `svg` file needed for gerbers.
- [ ] Create new Kicad project for PCB.
- [ ] Order PCB.
  - Check [JLC PCBs](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote?plateType=1).
- [ ] Wait...
- [ ] Enjoy 😎
